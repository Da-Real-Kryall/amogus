# Amogus "Virus"
A "virus" that replaces the screen with the "better call saul" gif, whilst playing the Breaking Bad theme song.
One of my irl friends whom will remain undisclosed requested that I make this.

## How to use:
1. Clone this repository to a directory, and open said directory in a terminal/cmd window.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Da-Real-Kryall/amogus-virus
cd ./amogus-virus
```
2. use cargo to build and run the project (you will need cargo installed)
```bash
cargo run --release
```
3. Bask in the ensuing glory.

## More context:
This is designed for use in a thumb drive alongside an `autorun.inf` file to run the compiled executable upon being plugged in.

Another thing; the executable actually has the audio and gif files bundled inside of it, so it can be run without the need for the files to be present in the same directory.
